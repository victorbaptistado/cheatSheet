                <li><strong>Basics:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comments: </strong>Python interprets anything after a <i>#</i> as a comment.
                    <li><strong>Multiline String: </strong>Use <i>""" written-comment """</i> or
                        <i>''' written-comment '''</i>. Can be used within variables and comments.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>print(): </strong>Is used to tell a computer to talk, to output.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variables: </strong>Example: <i>an_int = 2</i>.
                        Variables can be reassigned to a new value that is a different data type from its current value.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematics: </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Exponential: </strong>Use the notation <i>**</i>. e.g:
                                <i>print(8 ** 2)</i>.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Modulo: </strong>Is indicated by <i>%</i> and gives the remainder of a division
                                calculation. If the number is divisible, then the result of the modulo operator will
                                be 0. The modulo operator is useful in programming when we want to perform an action
                                every
                                nth-time the code is run.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Concatenation: </strong>
                        The <i>+</i> operator doesn’t just add two numbers, it can also “add” two strings.
                        If you want to concatenate a string with a number you will need to make the number a
                        string first, using the <i>str()</i> function. If you’re trying to <i>print()</i> a numeric
                        variable
                        you can use commas to pass it as a different argument rather than converting it to a string.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Input: </strong>Another way to assign a value to a variable is through user input.
                        While we output a variable’s value using <i>print()</i>, we assign information to a variable
                        using
                        <i>input()</i>. The <i>input()</i> function requires a prompt message, which it will print out
                        for the
                        user before they enter the new information. For example:
                        <i>likes_snakes = input("Do you like snakes? ")</i>
                        Once you have that information stored as a variable you can use it to simulate interaction:
                        >>> <i>print("Oh cool! I like " + likes_snakes + " too, but I think my favorite animal is
                            dog.")</i>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Boolean: </strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>True and False</strong> are the only bool types, and any variable that
                            is assigned one of these values is called a boolean variable.
                            Boolean variables can be created in several ways. The easiest way is to simply
                            assign True or False to a variable: <i>set_to_true = True</i>;
                            <i>set_to_false = False</i>.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Relational operators: </strong>Compare two items and return either True or
                            False. For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Equals:</strong> <i>==</i> ; <strong>Not equals:</strong> <i>!=</i> ;
                                These operators compare two items and return True or False if they are equal or not.</li>
                                <li><i>></i> greater than; <i>>=</i> greater than or equal to; <i></i> less than;
                                    <i><=</i> less than or equal to.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Boolean Operators:</strong>
                            The conditions you want to check in your conditional statement will require more
                            than one boolean expression to cover. In these cases, you can build larger boolean
                            expressions using boolean operators. These operators (also known as logical
                            operators) combine smaller boolean expressions into larger boolean expressions.

                <h3>Lists</h3>
                <li>In Python, a list is one of the many built-in data structures that allows
                    us to work with a collection
                    of data in sequential order. <i>heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]</i></li>
                <li><strong>Index: </strong>e.g: <i>print(calls[2])</i>.
                    We can use the index -i to select the item of a list in reverse, This selects
                    te last element in a list: <i>print(calls[-1])</i>.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Dimensional (2D) Lists: </strong>
                    We’ve seen that the items in a list can be numbers or strings. Lists can contain other
                    lists! We will commonly refer to these as two-dimensional (2D) lists. <i>heights = [["Noelle", 61],
                        ["Ava", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Mia", 64]]</i>
                    Two-dimensional lists can be using an additional set for each dimension past the first:
                    <i>noelles_height = heights[0][1]</i>
                </li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>.append(): </strong> add a single element to a list.</li>
                    <li><strong>.insert(): </strong>.insert() allows us to add an element to a specific
                        index in a list (all elements from the specified index and up to the last index are shifted one
                        index to the right). The <i>.insert()</i> method takes in two inputs:
                        The index you want to insert into. The element you want to insert at the specified index.
                        <i>store_line.insert(2, "Vikor")</i>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>+: </strong>When we want to add multiple items to a list, we can
                    use + to combine two lists (this is also known as concatenation).
                    <i>items_sold_new = items_sold + ["biscuit", "tart"]</i>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>.remove(): </strong>remove elements in a list. <i>shopping_line.remove("Chris")</i></li>
                    <li><strong>.pop(): </strong>is a method to remove elements at a specific index. It takes
                    an optional single input: The index for the element you want to remove. <i>cs_topics.pop(2)</i>
                    <i>.pop()</i> without an index will remove whatever the last element of the list is.</li>
                    <li><strong>.range(): </strong> The function <i>range()</i> takes a single input, and
                    generates numbers starting at 0 and ending at the number before the input.
                    <i>my_range = range(10)</i>.
                    In order to use this object as a list, we have to first convert it using another built-in
                    function called <i>list()</i>. The <i>list()</i> function takes in a single input for
                    the object you want to convert. <i>print(list(my_range))</i>.
                    If we call <i>range()</i> with two inputs, we can create a list that starts at a different
                    number. <i>range(2, 9)</i> would generate numbers starting at 2 and ending at 8
                    (just before 9). If we use a third input, we can create a list that “skips” numbers.
                    For example, range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than
                    the previous number: <i>my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)</i>. That would output [2, 4, 6, 8].
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>len()</strong>: gets the number of elements in a list. <i>print(len(my_list))</i></li>
                    <li><strong>slicing</strong>: extracts only a portion of a list.
                        <i>sliced_list = letters[1:6]</i>. If we want to select the first n elements of a list,
                        we could use the following code: <i>fruits[:n]</i>.
                        We can do something similar when we want to slice the last n elements in a list:
                        <i>fruits[-n:]</i>. Negative indices can also accomplish taking all but n last elements
                        of a list. <i>fruits[:-n]</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>count(): </strong>Suppose we have a list called letters that represents the letters in
                        the word
                        “Mississippi”: <i>letters = ["m", "i", "s", "s", "i", "s", "s", "i", "p", "p", "i"]</i>
                        If we want to know how many times <i>i</i> appears in this word, we can use: <i>num_i =
                            letters.count("i")</i></li>
                    <li><strong>sort(): </strong>When we want to sort a list in either numerical (1, 2, 3, …) or
                        alphabetical (a, b, c, …) order. <i>names.sort()</i>. It also provides us the option
                        to go in reverse, in descending order: <i>names.sort(reverse=True)</i>.</li>
                    <li><strong>sorted(): </strong> Is different from the <i>.sort()</i> method in two ways:
                        It comes before a list, instead of after as all built-in functions do.
                        It generates a new list rather than modifying the one that already exists.
                        <i>sorted_names = sorted(names)</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>help(): </strong>Python prints a link to documentation for us and provide
                        some details: <i>help("string")</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Zip Function: </strong>
                In Python, we have an assortment of built-in functions that allow us to build our programs
                faster and cleaner. One of those functions is zip().
                The <i>zip()</i> function allows us to quickly combine associated data-sets without needing to
                rely on multi-dimensional lists. <i>zip()</i> can work with many different scenarios, we
                are going to explore only a single one in this article.
                Let’s use a list of student names and associated heights as our example data set:
                Suppose that we already had a list of names and a list of heights:
                <i>names = ["Jenny", "Alexus", "Sam", "Grace"]</i>
                <i>heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]</i>
                If we wanted to create a nested list that paired each name with a height, we could use
                the built-in function <i>zip()</i>.
                The <i>zip()</i> function takes two (or more) lists as inputs and returns an object that
                contains a list of pairs. Each pair contains one element from each of the inputs.
                This is how we would do it for our names and heights lists:
                <i>names_and_heights = zip(names, heights)</i>
                If we were to then examine this new variable names_and_heights, we would find it looks a
                bit strange: <i>print(names_and_heights)</i>
                Would output: <i>< zip object at 0x7f1631e86b48></i>
                This zip object contains the location of this variable in our computer’s memory. Don’t
                worry though, it is fairly simple to convert this object into a useable list by using
                the built-in function <i>list()</i>:
                <i>converted_list = list(names_and_heights)</i> outputs:
                <i>[('Jenny', 61), ('Alexus', 70), ('Sam', 67), ('Grace', 64)]</i>
                Notice two things:
                Our data set has been converted from a zip memory object to an actual list
                (denoted by [ ])
                Our inner lists don’t use square brackets [ ] around the values. This is because they
                have been converted into tuples (an immutable type of list).

                <h3>String</h3>
                <li><strong>String: </strong>A string can be thought of as a list
                    of characters - like any other list, each character in a string has an index. E.g:
                    <i>first_initial = my_name[0]</i>. We can, for example, slice a string:
                    <i>temp_password = last_name[2:6]</i>. <strong>Video Project Thread Shed</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1AxPYJwHCw&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2F&embeds_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <li>.title() returns the string in title case, which means the first letter of each word

                    known as the delimiter). 
                    If we provide an argument for <i>.split()</i> we can dictate the character we want our string to be split on.

                    <i>.split</i> returns a list with each word in the string.
                    Newline or <i>\n</i> will allow us to split a multi-line string by line breaks and <i>\t</i> will allow 
                    us to split a string by tabs. </li>

                <h3>Tuples</h3>
                <li><strong>Tuples: </strong>
                    Is a collection of ordered, immutable elements enclosed in parentheses, separated by commas.
                    Tuples are similar to lists in many ways, but the main difference is that tuples are
                    immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.
                    <strong>Video</strong> <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDvRR8nWMNI&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2F&embeds_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title"
                        target="_blank">here</a>.
                </li>
                A tuple can be created using parentheses, <i>my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'four')</i>.
                Once a tuple is created, its elements can be accessed using indexing, just like a list.
                However, because tuples are immutable, you cannot modify the values of the elements once
                the tuple has been created.
                <li><strong>Tuple unpacking: </strong> Allows you to assign the elements of
                a tuple to multiple variables in one step. <i>a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)</i>.
                In this case, a is assigned the value of 1, b is assigned the value of 2, and c is assigned
                the value of 3. This can be a convenient way to assign multiple variables at once.</li>

                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <li><strong>For Loop: </strong>Tells in advance how many times the loop will need to
                    iterate, because we will be working on a collection with a predefined length.</li>

                        want to perform a certain action multiple times.</li>

                in it by providing the key. <i>zodiac_elements["earth"]</i>
                But this solution is not sustainable, because it throws an error when there's no such key and 
                we can’t predict every key a user may call and add all of those placeholder 
                values to our dictionary.
                Dictionaries have a <strong>.get()</strong> method to search for a value instead of the 
                my_dict[key] notation we have been using. If the key you are trying to <i>.get()</i> does not exist, 
                it will return <i>None</i> by default: <i>zodiac_elements.get("earth")</i>. 
                You can also specify a value to return if the key doesn’t exist: 
                <i>zodiac_elements.get("energy", "fire")</i>.</li>
                <li><strong>Deleting key/value: </strong>We can use <i>.pop()</i> to remove a key when we know what's the 
                key/value. <i>health_points += available_items.pop("stamina grains", 0)</i>, this removes "stamina grains"
                grains from available_items and adds the removed value to health_points.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessing all Keys: </strong>Sometimes we want to operate on all of the keys in a 
                dictionary. We can do this with the <i>built-in list()</i>. 
                There's also <i>.keys()</i> method that returns a dict_keys object. A dict_keys object is a 
                view object, which provides a look at the current state of the dictionary, without the user 
                being able to modify anything. It can be used in the place of a list for iteration:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            for student in test_scores.keys():
                print(student)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <li><strong>Accessing all Values: </strong>Dictionaries have a <i>.values()</i> method that returns 
                a dict_values object (just like a dict_keys object but for values) with all of the values 
                in the dictionary. It can be used in the place of a list for iteration:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            for score_list in test_scores.values():
                print(score_list)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <li><strong>Accessing all Items: </strong>You can get both the keys and the values with the 
                <i>.items()</i> method. Like <i>.keys()</i> and <i>.values()</i>, it returns a dict_list object. 
                Each element of the dict_list returned by <i>.items()</i> is a tuple consisting of <i>(key, value)</i>.
                So for iteration:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            for company, value in biggest_brands.items():
                print(company + " has a value of " + str(value) + " billion dollars. ")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Files</h3>
                <li><strong>Reading a File: </strong>
                Below opens a file object called <i>cool_doc</i> and creates a new indented block where you can 
                read the contents of the opened file. We then read the contents of the file <i>cool_doc</i> 
                using <i>cool_doc.read()</i> and save the resulting string into the variable <i>cool_contents</i>. 
                Then we print </i>cool_contents</i>, which outputs the statement Wowsers!
                The <i>with</i> keyword invokes something called a context manager for the file that we’re calling 
                <i>open()</i> on. This context manager takes care of opening the file when we call <i>open()</i> 
                and then closing the file after we leave the indented block.

                <h3>Class</h3>
                <li><strong>Class: </strong>is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information 
                that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data.
                A class must be <strong>instantiated</strong>. In other words, we must create an instance of the class, in order 
                to breathe life into the schematic. <i>type()</i> returns the actual class an object is an implementation of.

                </pre>
                <li><strong>Class Variable: </strong>When we want the same data to be available to every instance of a class we use a class variable. 
                A class variable is a variable that’s the same for every instance of the class.</li>

                <li><strong>Class Methods: </strong>Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class. 
                The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method. Convention 
                recommends that we name this first argument <strong>self</strong>. Methods always have at least this one argument.</li>
                <pre>

                </pre>
                <li><strong>Contructor: </strong>There are several methods that we can define in a Python 
                class that have special behavior. These methods are sometimes called “magic,” because they 
                behave differently from regular methods. Another popular term is dunder methods, so-named 
                because they have two underscores (double-underscore abbreviated to “dunder”) on either 
                side of them.The first dunder method we’re going to use is the <strong>__init__()</strong> method 
                (note the two underscores before and after the word “init”). This method is used to 
                initialize a newly created object. It is called every time the class is instantiated.
                Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated are called <strong>constructors</strong>. 
                The word “constructor” is used to describe similar features in other object-oriented 
                programming languages but programmers who refer to a constructor in Python are usually 
                talking about the <i>__init__()</i> method. Below we created a class called Shouter and every time 
                we create an instance of Shouter the program prints out a shout.</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            class Shouter:
                def __init__(self):
                    print("HELLO?!")
                
                shout1 = Shouter()
                # prints "HELLO?!"
                
                shout2 = Shouter()
                # prints "HELLO?!"
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <li><strong>Instance Variables: </strong>The data held by an object is referred to as an 
                instance variable. 
                Instance variables aren’t shared by all instances of a class — they are variables that are 
                specific to the object they are attached to.
                A class is a schematic for a data type and an object is an instance 
                of a class, but why is there such a strong need to differentiate the two if each object 
                can only have the methods and class variables the class has? This is because each instance 
                of a class can hold different kinds of data.</li>

                <li><strong>Attribute Functions: </strong>
                Instance variables and class variables are both accessed similarly in Python, because 
                they are both considered attributes of an object. If we aren’t sure if an object has an 
                attribute or not, <i>hasattr()</i> will return True if an object has a given attribute 
                and False otherwise <i>hasattr(object, “attribute”)</i>. If we want to get the actual value of 
                the attribute, <i>getattr()</i> 
                is a Python function that will return the value of a given object and attribute. In this 
                function, we can also supply a third argument that will be the default if the object does 
                not have the given attribute. <i>getattr(object, “attribute”, default)</i>.</li>

                <li><strong>Everything is an Object: </strong>
                Attributes can be added to user-defined objects after instantiation, so it’s possible 
                for an object to have some attributes that are not explicitly defined in an object’s 
                constructor. We can use the <i>dir()</i> function to investigate an object’s attributes at runtime. 
                <i>dir()</i> is short for directory and offers an organized presentation of object attributes.</li>
