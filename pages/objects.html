            <h2>REVIEW OBJECTS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects store collections of key-value pairs.</li>
                <li> Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.</li>
                <li>An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.</li>
                <li>You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.</li>
                <li>We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.</li>
                <li>We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.</li>
                <li>Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with const.</li>
                <li>Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.</li>
                <li>We can iterate through objects using the For...in syntax.</li>
                <li>Variables are not classified as objects. They are their own classification as a storage address.</li>
                <li>JavaScript makes an arbitrary distinction between values: Primitive values and Objects. Primitive values include boolean, numbers, strings, null and undefined. While everything else in a JavaScript is said to be an object which means window, JSON, Math and even functions and arrays are Objects as well.</li>

            <h2>ADVANCED OBJECTS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.</li>
                <li>The this keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties 
                of the calling object.</li>
                <li>Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.</li>
                <li>The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.</li>
                <li>We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.</li>
                <li>JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code (e.g: _property).</li>
                <li>The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.</li>
                <li>Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.</li>
                <li>Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.</li>
                <li>There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.</li>
                <li>As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!</li>

            <h2>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</h2>
            <li>Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way that’s easy to reuse, debug, 
            and understand for human readers.</li>
            <li>We can work with functions the same way we work with any other type of data, including 
            reassigning them to new variables.</li>
            <li>JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any other object.</li>
            <li>Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters.</li>
            <li>A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters (callback), returns a function, or both.</li>

            <h2>JSON & YAML</h2>
            <li><strong>JSON</strong>
            stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for 
            humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text-based format and is 
            often used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.
            JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and uses key-value pairs to represent data. 
            The keys are always strings, while the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other JSON objects.
            JSON supports a wide range of data types and is therefore a flexible format that can be used to represent data 
            in many different contexts.</li>

            <li><strong>YAML</strong> is a standard format for storing data. It originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language but now 
            stands for YAML Ain’t Markup Language. Because of its emphasis on human readability, YAML is increasingly 
            relied upon for configuration files. It can also be used for log files, debugging complex data structures, 
            interprocess messaging, and cross-language data sharing.</li>

            <button id="showCode59" onclick="showCode('displayCode59', 'showCode59')">Display</button>
            <div id="displayCode59">
                <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode59', 'showCode59')">Close</button>

                capitals:
                Japan: Tokyo
                Argentina: Buenos Aires
                oceans:
                - Indian
                - Atlantic
                - Arctic
                - Pacific

            <li><strong>YAML VS JSON: </strong>YAML is often compared to JSON due to their similarities. Both formats are human-readable and can represent 
            complex data structures. However, there are some key differences. YAML is generally considered more 
            human-readable due to its use of whitespace for separating objects rather than curly braces or brackets. 
            It also offers additional features such as comments and object references. JSON, however, is superior when 
            it comes to performance, specifically the speed at which a computer can parse it.</li>
