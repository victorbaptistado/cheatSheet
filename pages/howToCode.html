              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Understand the project's requirements and ask any questions: </strong>
                  First, you need to make sure you completely, absolutely, 100% understand the 
                  requirements of the project. If any part of the requirements are unclear, it is 
                  up to you to reach out to your contact and ask questions.
                  Sometimes companies will purposefully make their requirements vague, in order to see 
                  how you approach the problem. In these cases, it is always best to ask questions as 
                  it shows you are thinking about the problem and not just making assumptions and building 
                  an app to a vague spec.</li>
                  <li><strong>Identify technical decisions you need to make: </strong>
                  Your next step will be to identify the technical decisions that you need to make. 
                  Making a list of all of your technical decisions up front and thinking about them 
                  before you’re in the middle of building your app will help you immensely. Not only 
                  will it cut down on time figuring things out later, but it will allow you to make big 
                  picture decisions up front, as opposed to trying to focus on both the big picture and 
                  the small details at the same time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Technical design & whiteboarding: </strong>
                  Now it’s time to plan out the rest of your app. For anything that you need to draw 
                  out, now is the perfect time to do that. Thinking through these decisions at the 
                  start serves two purposes: You’ll be able to reference these drawings and your original plan while 
                  you’re building your app. Then if you get stuck at any point, you can 
                  always come back to your notes.
                  Later, when you are having a discussion with an engineer about your project, 
                  you can use these notes as a reference when they ask you why you 
                  made certain design or architecture decisions. Once you’ve thought through and answered some of the bigger design and 
                  architecture questions for your challenge, the next step is research. If 
                  you’re planning to use a new technology or something you’re a bit rusty with,
                  use this time to search for documentation and other resources.</li>
                  <li><strong> Test plan: </strong>
                  Another very important step to take before writing a line of code is developing 
                  a test plan. Although you won’t get peer feedback on this test plan, it will help 
                  you look at the challenge from a different angle, making sure you’re meeting all 
                  of the requirements. By thinking through and writing out a test plan before you 
                  start coding, you are able to brainstorm possible edge cases that you should account 
                  for in your code and you will use this as a basis for testing your app later.</li>
                  <li><strong>App setup plan: </strong>
                  If you’re starting an app from scratch, figure out if there are any generators you 
                  can use to make your app setup easier and faster. Application setup is one of the 
                  hardest parts of take-home coding challenges, because it’s something that developers 
                  do rather infrequently. Best practices are always changing, so it’s easy to forget 
                  how to do. Also, when setting up an app with a specific combination of technologies 
                  for the first time, it can be challenging to get everything configured and working 
                  together properly.
                  If you are not using a generator, reading documentation and finding working examples
                  are the two most important steps you can take. Being able to play with a working 
                  example and compare it to your own app will help you if you get stuck.</li>
                  <li><strong>Organize your tasks: </strong>
                  The last step before you start coding is to break down and organize your tasks. 
                  Breaking down your tasks is essential because it will help you stay on track as 
                  you’re working on your challenge, and it will give you a game plan for execution. 
                  Note that you shouldn’t be a perfectionist here, because there will always be 
                  unexpected bumps in the road.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Here is an example task list for a classic Tic Tac Toe app:</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Understand requirements</li>
                          <li>Choose technologies</li>
                          <li>Brainstorm test plan</li>
                          <li>Hello World app setup</li>
                          <li>Build board with HTML/CSS</li>
                          <li>Implement Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript</li>
                          <li>Add reset button</li>
                          <li>Make board responsive</li>
                          <li>Add ability to add additional boards</li>
                          <li>Error handling & tests</li>
                          <li>Code cleanup</li>
                          <li>README</li>                       
                      </ul>
                      <li>Some of these tasks can be broken down even further into smaller steps. 
                      For example, in order to implement the Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript, 
                      here are some smaller tasks:</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Add a click handler to each square that logs a message</li>
                          <li>Get click handler to add an X to the square that is clicked</li>
                          <li>Get clicks to alternate between X and O</li>
                          <li>Don’t allow a square to be clicked more than once</li>
                          <li>Implement a function to find the winner and end the game</li>
                          <li>Handle a tie game</li>
                      </ul>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <hr/>
          <h3>Coding Priorities</h3>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Make it work</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Make it pretty</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Make it fast</strong></li>
              <p class="center"><strong>More info</strong></p>
              <button type="button" id="showCode82" onclick="showCode('displayCode82', 'showCode82')">Display</button>
              <div id="displayCode82">
                  <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode82', 'showCode82')">Close</button>
                  <li><strong>Make it work: </strong>
                  When you’re given a take-home coding challenge, no matter 
                  what you do, the most crucial part of the challenge is to make it work. 
                  If you submit an app that has a nice UI, that will not matter if your 
                  app does not work or meet all of the requirements. Because building features 
                  to spec is a key aspect of your future job as a developer, you first and 
                  foremost need to focus on the functionality of your app and prioritize that above all else.
                  This is also key if you are low on or run out of time. Coding challenges can be a lot of work, 
                  especially if you want to go above and beyond to ensure that you make it to the next interview 
                  round. But, I can guarantee that you will not make it to the next round if your app doesn’t 
                  function properly or is missing some key components.
                  So, if you’re building a front-end app, this means focusing on making it work first, and styling/UI last. 
                  If you are building a back-end or full-stack app, focus on making it work before trying to refactor your 
                  code into the most elegant solution, and only then worry about optimization.
                  Even if you end up without any time to go back and refactor your code or style your UI, having a 
                  working app to present is more important. You can always talk to the interviewer about how you would 
                  improve your app, and refactoring some of your code might even be part of the next round of interviewing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Make it pretty: </strong>
                  Make it pretty has two interpretations here. One is making the code pretty, and the other is making 
                  the UI pretty. Making the code pretty can be done in several ways. First, ensure indentation is 
                  consistent and your code is readable. Second, if you got something to work in a quick, hacky way, 
                  think about how you can refactor it to be a more elegant solution without overcomplicating it.
                  If you’re doing a front-end or full-stack challenge, you can also make the UI pretty as part of this 
                  step. Whether you use a library or write your own custom styles for your app, making the UI look good 
                  will show your interviewer that you’re taking the user experience into consideration when building a feature.
                  For some more front-end-focused challenges, you’ll be given a specific mockup to match. In these cases,
                  making sure you’re detail oriented down to the last pixel is incredibly important. Part of your role may 
                  involve translating mockups from designers into user interfaces, so companies want to get a sense of how 
                  you approach those types of tasks.</li>
                  <li><strong>Make it fast: </strong>
                  Once you’ve made your app work, made it pretty (in the code, UI, or both), it may be time to make it 
                  fast! This is where understanding performance and BigO notation comes in handy.
                  You should take a look at your code and see if there are any areas where increasing the scale might 
                  be an issue. For example, are you using a double for loop somewhere? What if the arrays you’re looping 
                  over become super long?
                  If you think about these kinds of edge cases, you can then come up with plan to improve your code. 
                  Taking something that would have been running O(n) and making it O(1) will show that you’re thinking 
                  about performance when you’re building things.</li>
              </div>
          </ul>
          <hr/>
          <h3>Proper code</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>There are several things you can do to make your code stand out. You want your code to be:
              readable, easy to follow, well organized, clean (properly indented, free of syntax errors and unnecessary whitespace).</li>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>How to name things</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>How to use comments effectively</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>How to format your code as you write it</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="center"><strong>More info</strong></p>
              <button type="button" id="showCode83" onclick="showCode('displayCode83', 'showCode83')">Display</button>
              <div id="displayCode83">
                  <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode83', 'showCode83')">Close</button>
                  <li><strong>How to name things: </strong>
                  Naming is one of the hardest problems in programming. One of the keys to naming things 
                  is to make sure you’re naming them in a way that another developer who is unfamiliar with 
                  the code can easily jump in and understand.
                  For functions, think about what exactly the function is doing. Is the function checking whether 
                  there is a winner on a row of a Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be checkRow. Is your 
                  function handling a click on a square of the Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be handleClick.
                  One quick tip: if you find yourself losing your flow because you keep stopping to 
                  think of the perfect name, split your process into two steps. First, write working 
                  code with any names (like foo, bar, and baz). Then take a second pass through to improve them.</li>
                  <li><strong>How to use comments effectively: </strong>
                  Adding comments can be a great way to capture what you were thinking at the time you wrote 
                  a specific piece of code. This can be useful to you, or anyone else who comes across your code 
                  in the future and needs to understand it, tweak it, or rewrite it.
                  Think of comments as adding clarity to your code. But, pay attention, because there is such a 
                  thing as too many comments.
                  <strong>Do not need comments:</strong>When you declare a variable and when you declare a function.
                  <strong>Make comments on:</strong> HTML, CSS, Technically tricky lines of code.
                  Let’s say you have a really long <strong>HTML</strong> file with A LOT of divs. Comments can be a good 
                  way to signal which div tags close which sections.
                  In <strong>CSS</strong>, comments are a good way to divide up your styles if you have a lot of styles in one file. 
                  This way, when you come back to the code later and want to make a change, it’s easier to find the 
                  styles for that one section you need to update.
                  Comments in CSS are also very useful whenever you are hard-coding any math or adding an arbitrary 
                  number of pixels as margin, padding, and so on. Comments can be useful to explain things like this 
                  that are specific to your application.
                  One of the best uses for comments is when you’ve written code that is <strong>technically difficult</strong> or just not intuitive. 
                  You should always strive for simple, understandable code as much as possible. However, sometimes you will have 
                  confusing code — maybe you’ve chained a bunch of methods together or are using a complex regular expression — and 
                  it would help to explain what is happening in a comment.</li>
                  <li><strong>How to format your code as you write it: </strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Choose <strong>tabs or spaces</strong> and be consistent across your entire application (i.e. no 2 spaces 
                      in some files, 4 spaces in others)</li>
                      <li><strong>Indent</strong> your code properly as you go so that it stays readable and isn’t all over the place</li>
                      <li>Get rid of trailing whitespace! Whitespace can sometimes wreck havoc, so it’s best to just 
                      get rid of it as you write your code.</li>
                      <li>Keep your <strong>syntax consistent</strong> throughout your entire app. If you’re using a linter, this will 
                      be easier, but requires setting one up. If you don’t have time to set one up, pay attention. </li>
                      <li>Don’t use ES5 in some places in your app and ES6 in others. <strong>Pick one</strong> and stick with it!</li>
                      <li><strong>Remove unnecessary logging and debug statements</strong> when you’re done using them! Unless logging 
                      is part of your application, you’ll want to remove any temporary statements you were using while building your app.</li>
                      <li>Always leave a <strong>newline</strong> at the end of every file.</li>
                  </ul>
