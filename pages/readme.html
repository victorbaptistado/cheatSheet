        <h2>README</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing a great README is not hard, and you will stand out a great deal from the other applicants with one. 
            Write your README in markdown so it looks nice!
            Here are the five sections I’d recommend you include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Installation instructions</li>
                <li>Discussion of technologies used</li>
                <li>A section demonstrating that you met the requirements</li>
                <li>If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them</li>
                <li>For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="center"><strong>More info</strong></p>
            <button type="button" id="showCode84" onclick="showCode('displayCode84', 'showCode84')">Display</button>
            <div id="displayCode84">
                <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode84', 'showCode84')">Close</button>
                <li><strong>Installation instructions: </strong>
                When writing your README, don’t make any assumptions. Write out all of the 
                steps to run your app locally and test them yourself. This includes cloning 
                the repo from Github, running installation commands, and starting up a server. 
                Also, make sure to include versions of software that you are using. This will 
                ensure that the developer reviewing your code has a seamless experience setting
                up and running your app, and if they do happen to run into any trouble due to 
                versioning, they will have all of the information they need right there in the README.</li>
                <li><strong>Discussion of technologies used: </strong>
                This section is as simple as it sounds — make a list of all of the technologies 
                you used including frameworks and libraries. If you had to find a library for a 
                specific piece of functionality in your take-home challenge, mention it here and include a link to the docs.</li>
                <li><strong>A section demonstrating that you met the requirements:</strong>
                Usually your take-home challenge will come with some sort of requirements spec, so make sure 
                to include a section in your README where you describe the requirements and how you met them. 
                In some cases, you can take the product spec you were given and write a short explanation of 
                how you met each requirement in a list. In other cases, you can simply include a short paragraph 
                explaining how you satisfied the requirements. It’s totally up to you how you do it, just make 
                sure you include it.</li>

                <li><strong>If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them</strong>
                Similar to the requirements section above, you’ll want to highlight any bonuses you completed 
                while working on the take-home challenge. If you attempted a bonus, but couldn’t quite get 
                something to work, then the README is also a good place to address that. You can discuss the 
                approach or approaches you tried and what worked or didn’t work.</li>

                <li><strong>For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity</strong>
                If you had to write any algorithms or data structures as part of your take-home challenge, 
                it’s helpful to include the space-time complexity of your final algorithm. This can be done in Big O notation.</li>
