            <h2>JSON & YAML</h2>
            <li><strong>JSON</strong>
            stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for 
            humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text-based format and is 
            often used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.
            JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and uses key-value pairs to represent data. 
            The keys are always strings, while the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other JSON objects.
            JSON supports a wide range of data types and is therefore a flexible format that can be used to represent data 
            in many different contexts.</li>

            <li><strong>YAML</strong> is a standard format for storing data. It originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language but now 
            stands for YAML Ain’t Markup Language. Because of its emphasis on human readability, YAML is increasingly 
            relied upon for configuration files. It can also be used for log files, debugging complex data structures, 
            interprocess messaging, and cross-language data sharing.</li>

            <li><strong>YAML VS JSON: </strong>YAML is often compared to JSON due to their similarities. Both formats are human-readable and can represent 
            complex data structures. However, there are some key differences. YAML is generally considered more 
            human-readable due to its use of whitespace for separating objects rather than curly braces or brackets. 
            It also offers additional features such as comments and object references. JSON, however, is superior when 
            it comes to performance, specifically the speed at which a computer can parse it.</li>
