            <h2>Postman</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Postman is a GUI that aids in the development of APIs by 
                making it easy to test requests and their responses in an organized way.</li>
                <li>API requests with <strong>Postman</strong>(GUI) & <strong>cURL</strong>(Command Line)
                <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/making-api-requests-postman-curl/" target="_blank">here</a></li>

                <h3>API Requests</h3>
                <li><strong>Initializing: </strong>
                Set the URL connected to the server & the HTTP method.</li>
                <li><strong>GET: </strong>
                Write proper URL to GET request.</li>
                <li><strong>POST: </strong> It is <u>non-idempotent</u>, meaning that two identical 
                POST requests will create two new resources.<br>
                Select <strong>POST</strong> method, Body => Raw (set to JSON), 
                write the Post request. As the output, an id will be created as a property
                inside "user". Example: </li>
                <pre><code>{"user": {"username": "Victor", "password": "Rego"}}</code></pre>
                <li><strong>PUT: </strong>It is <u>idempotent</u>, meaning that two identical PUT requests will modify the same
                resource.<br>
                A <strong>PUT</strong> request requires the entire body to be sent through; if any data 
                is missing, that data will be wiped (except automatic values like auto-incrementing 
                IDs and timestamps).</li>
                <li><strong>PATCH: </strong>Updates an existing resource, and does not require
                sending the entire body with the request.</li>
                <li><strong>DELETE: </strong>Removes a resource. No values to send.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication: </strong>
                In Postman, you'll go to Headers and add Authorization as the key and Bearer < JWT_TOKEN > as
                the value to send authentication values. You can also go to Headers, click Presets, Manage
                Presets, and put your own reusable variables in for any headers or values you'll be reusing a lot.</li>
