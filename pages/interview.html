        <h2>Technical Interview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is a technical interview?</strong>
            Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for tech professionals. 
            This process also includes phone screenings and in-person interviews, but the 
            assignments you complete during technical interviews help interviewers evaluate 
            your skills. While you’ll likely be asked to solve a problem, don’t worry too much about getting 
            it right. Interviewers are typically more interested in your thought process than 
            your solution. Assignments vary by company, but common tasks include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Debugging existing code.</li>
                <li>Building a small project.</li>
                <li>Adding a feature to an existing code base.</li>
                <li>Explaining the design and architecture of a technical problem.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Preparing for a technical interview</strong>
            Preparation is the key to a successful technical interview. You might not know 
            what your assignment will be, but there are several steps you can take to ensure 
            that you’re equipped for anything. Plus, your interviewer is bound to be impressed 
            by your readiness.
            To help you hit the ground running, our developers put together a list of tips 
            to help you prepare for a technical interview.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask questions leading up to your interview: </strong>
                By the time you have your technical interview, you’ve probably already spoken 
                with the company’s recruiter or hiring manager. Feel free to ask them questions 
                about what you should expect or the technologies used by the team you’ll be joining.</li>
                <li><strong>Master your programming languages: </strong>
                You can usually use your preferred programming language for the technical interview, 
                and knowing its ins and outs will help you make a good impression.
                Mastering your programming language will allow you to give the assignment your 
                full attention instead of wasting time figuring out syntax. Plus, you might get 
                the chance to wow your interviewer with a lesser-known feature or method.
                It’s also worth taking the time to learn data structures and algorithms. 
                Not only will this make your coding more efficient, but it’ll also deepen 
                your understanding of the concepts employed in your technical interview.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice with projects and coding challenges: </strong>
                Theoretical knowledge will only take you so far. Completing coding challenges 
                and projects will help instill the skills you’ll use in your new career. 
                Plus, the more you practice, the faster you’ll become. Imagine how impressed 
                your interviewer will be when you’ve efficiently solved the problem in half 
                of the allotted time.
                As you complete your projects, take note of how you approached the problems 
                you encountered. Taking the time to analyze your approach helps develop your 
                problem-solving ability and improve your capacity for technical presentations.
                You could also practice with technical interview courses. Our Technical Interview
                Practice with Python, Java, and 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/technical-interview-practice-with-javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
                courses cover advanced knowledge and 
                skills, with practice problems to help you nail your next interview.
                <li><strong>Memorize a story that illustrates your skill: </strong>
                At some point during your technical interview, you may be asked about your 
                prior experience. Having a story readily available will help illustrate your 
                familiarity with the knowledge and skills required for the position.
                Use the notes you took while completing a project to create an outline and 
                commit it to memory. Then, test it out on people. Share the story with your 
                friends until you’re able to tell it without any stammering or pauses. This 
                will help you sound confident during your technical interview, and being able
                to succinctly describe the problems you encountered and your solutions will 
                demonstrate your expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>Other preparation tips: </strong>
                The tips listed above will help ensure that you’re fully equipped for your
                next technical interview. Still, sometimes it’s not what you say but how you 
                say it. Check out these 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/technical-interview-preparation-tips/" target="_blank">tips from our Curriculum Developers</a> 
                for more advice on how to prepare for a technical interview.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>How to pass a technical interview: </strong>
            After taking all the steps to ensure that you’re ready to put your 
            best foot forward, it’s time to take your technical interview. 
            Technical interviews can occur both in-person or remotely. If it’s 
            in-person, you may be asked to write your code on a whiteboard. 
            If it’s remote, you might use a code editor.
            Regardless of where it’s held, there are several steps you can take 
            to make sure your technical interview is a success.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand the problem: </strong>
                Taking the time to understand the problem will make or break your interview. 
                Too often, candidates rush in and start coding. Don’t be afraid to talk through it aloud.
                Also, feel free to ask questions. It’s better to clarify any confusion 
                at the beginning than when you’re halfway through your solution. 
                <u>Inquire about edge cases, intended program behaviors, error 
                handling — anything that might occur to you</u>. Not only will this show your 
                critical thinking skills, but it’ll also illustrate your openness to feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Explain your approach:</strong>
                Again, interviewers are primarily concerned with your thought process. 
                Here’s your chance to give them a look.
                Back in December, we spoke with Daniel Chae, a programmer and data analyst 
                from Los Angeles. While discussing the hiring process, Daniel stressed the 
                importance of explaining your approach in technical interviews. He breaks it 
                down into two steps:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying your core goal.</li>
                    <li>Generating a step by step process you can explain aloud.
                    Explaining your approach allows interviewers to better understand how 
                    you go about tackling a problem. Daniel describes 
                    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/explain-your-approach-during-interviews/" target="_blank">here</a>
                    how, despite his solution not being perfect, explaining his approach gave him a leg up 
                    in a technical interview with Google.
                    Don’t stop explaining, even when you run into a problem. Talking through it 
                    will help you organize your thoughts and find a solution. Plus, your interviewer 
                    is much more likely to give you a hand if you’re already engaged in conversation.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Optimize your solution: </strong>
                Going back to optimize your solution is a great way to display your attention
                to detail. Tidy up your code. Make sure you’re not using complicated functions 
                for a problem that can be solved with your language’s basic features. If you’re 
                familiar with 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/big-o-notation" target="_blank">Big-O notation</a>, 
                discuss it with your interviewer.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical interview questions and answers: </strong>
                Certain positions require specific languages, and some technical interviews 
                will test your capacity with them. Below, we’ve compiled a list of interview 
                questions covering the basic and advanced features of some of the most popular 
                programming languages:</li>

            <h3>Whiteboarding</h3>
            <li>This lesson covers strategies to improve performance in a whiteboarding interview. 
            Each exercise features a step in the interview with a video
            demonstration of the technique. Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgAVxPV9JVk&t=10s" target="_blank">
            here</a>. <strong>Review video </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eADUTW9mrEo&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2F&embeds_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title" target="_blank">here</a>.. 
            The steps are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clarify the Problem: </strong>
                Whiteboarding interviews begin with a problem from the interviewer. 
                The interviewee must be confident they understand the dimensions of the problem!
                Software development is full of ambiguity. Programming requires concrete 
                deliverables, but company needs can be murky. Even when the need is clear, 
                a feature could have dozens of possible implementations. The ability to clearly 
                define a problem is an important skill to demonstrate.

                <button type="button" id="showCode104" onclick="showCode('displayCode104', 'showCode104')">Display</button>
                <div id="displayCode104">
                    <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode104', 'showCode104')">Close</button>
                    <li>When the interviewer presents their technical question, repeat the question 
                    back to the interviewer <strong>in your own words</strong>. This gives you a moment to think 
                    and will resolve any glaring misunderstandings.
                    Once you’ve repeated the question, <strong>ask every clarifying question that comes 
                    to mind.</strong>
                    Assumptions must be communicated to the interviewer so there is agreement on 
                    the scope of the problem.
                    For example, if asked:
                    <i>Write a function that returns duplicate characters in string.</i>
                    Here are some questions which may come to mind:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the desired return value?</li>
                        <li>True|False, a list of characters, or …?</li>
                        <li>Do punctuation and spaces count as “characters”?</li>
                        <li>Should case be considered?</li>
                        <li>are <i>"a"</i> and <i>"A"</i> duplicates?</li>
                        <li>Should we be checking for Unicode characters?</li>
                        <li>Can we assume it’s a 26 character alphabet?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr/>
                    <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>We’ll apply these steps to a single problem through the rest of the lesson.
                    Given a list of numbers, return whether the list contains Pythagorean Triplets.
                    Rephrase this problem in your own words and write that down.
                    Then, write down every question or assumption you have.</li>
                    <hr/>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Create Inputs: </strong>
                When the question is clear, we then produce concrete inputs and outputs. 
                These inputs guide a solution for the remainder of the interview so write 
                them on the board!
                You may still be unclear how to solve the problem in code, but it’s certain 
                that given an input, X, your function will produce an output, Y.
                <strong>Video </strong><a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <p class="center"><strong>More info</strong></p>
                <button type="button" id="showCode105" onclick="showCode('displayCode105', 'showCode105')">Display</button>
                <div id="displayCode105">
                    <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode105', 'showCode105')">Close</button>
                    <li>Make one input the happy path: input that reflects a common scenario.
                    For example, you’re asked to write a function which capitalizes the first 
                    letter of an input string. A good input could be "apple", which returns 
                    "Apple" because this demonstrates the function’s purpose.
                    If the input were "Apple", it would return "Apple". That’s correct but less 
                    informative.
                    Also think about edge cases, or inputs which do not reflect a common scenario 
                    and may cause problems.
                    For the capitalization function, what should you return if given None as input? 
                    Or a number?</li>
                    <hr/>
                    <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>
                    Write inputs and outputs for the Pythagorean Triplet problem.
                    Try to give yourself a few different cases.</li>
                    <hr/>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Outline the Solution: </strong>
                It’s time to start breaking down the problem by category.
                Given a question which requires the use of a stack, what do you know 
                about stacks? Have you encountered other problems that use stacks and 
                how were they solved?
                Is this a searching question? Can you sort the input and will that help? 
                Does this problem sound like it can be modeled as a graph, with vertices 
                and connected edges?
                Understanding the applications of different data structures is very 
                useful! The more questions you practice, the more you will be able to 
                see patterns between problems. <strong>Video </strong>

                    <li>This step varies the most because it requires details of the specific 
                    problem, but regardless of the question make certain you are communicating 
                    with the interviewer as a potential co-worker. <strong>Show them your thought 
                    process!</strong>
                    During this step, the interviewer may make suggestions on how to proceed. 
                    Acknowledge the interviewer and incorporate their suggestions into your 
                    approach. <strong>Don’t disregard their input! It gives the impression you would be difficult 
                    to work with on the job.</strong>
                    When you and the interviewer are satisfied with a workable solution, write 
                    the steps next to your input. Follow these steps as you write code on the 
                    board.</li>
                    <hr/>
                    <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>Come up with an outline of how to solve the Pythagorean Triplet problem.
                    Don’t worry about efficiency, just aim for high-level steps which will 
                    produce the correct output.</li>

                </div>
                <li><strong>Code the Solution</strong>
                We’ve finally come to the portion where you’ll write some code! 
                Previous steps improve your odds for success because you have an outline 
                and clear inputs for testing.
                <strong>Writing code on the board is a collaborative process.</strong> Refer to 
                your outline and explain the step you’re implementing.
                The goal is to be facing the interviewer when talking through the implementation

                    <i>for i in range(len(input_list)):</i>.
                    When you’re finished with the implementation, look it over for any mistaken

                    Before writing each step on paper, say what you will do out loud. Better 
                    to practice by yourself than in a real interview!</li>

                With a working implementation on the whiteboard, use the test inputs to 
                walk through the evaluation of your code.
                Write out any temporary variables on the board and update them when they change
                during execution.</li>

                    you catch any logical errors which you may not have noticed in earlier steps.
                    If you catch an error, don’t panic! Mistakes happen. Explain the issue and 
                    talk through what you can do to fix the bug.
                    Your interviewer may want to see you write the correction or they may be 
                    satisfied with the explanation. <strong>Video </strong>

                    <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>Use your test inputs and implementation to 
                    talk through your solution.
                    Again, say each line aloud so you become more comfortable speaking about

                works, but you’re not quite done.
                Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution. With this step you 
                are demonstrating that you care about the efficiency of your code.
                Explain your code’s big O notation. If you can optimize to a more efficient 
                runtime, explain how that would work. If you can’t optimize, explain why it’s 
                not possible. <strong>Video </strong>

        <h2>Behavioral Interviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The behavioral interview can take on many forms. More than likely, this interview 
            will be with a recruiter or a senior company manager. It consists of questions focusing 
            on your ability to react to certain industry situations, assesses the greatest strengths 
            and weaknesses of your character, and your ability to overcome certain situations. In 
            this section, we’ll take a look at some tips for how to approach this style of job 
            interview. 
            <li><strong>Before the Interview</strong></li>
            <p class="center"><strong>More info</strong></p>
            <button type="button" id="showCode125" onclick="showCode('displayCode125', 'showCode125')">Display</button>
            <div id="displayCode125">
                <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode125', 'showCode125')">Close</button>
                <li><strong>Research the Company and the Interviewer: </strong>
                You are likely to succeed in your interview if you are familiar with the products of 
                the company you want to work for. Take a closer look and see if you can identify the 
                company’s vision and mission. Why do they mesh with you? Also, do some research on the 
                actual product you would be working on to make sure you are one step ahead of other 
                job candidates.
                Don’t stop at just the company! Most recruiters are happy to tell you who you will 
                be interviewing with. Look your interviewer up on LinkedIn or GitHub to see if you 
                can find anything out that’ll give you an edge – maybe your interviewer has a side 
                business or hobby you can connect with and mention in your interview.
                An interviewer is likely to remember you as that person “who plays the same musical 
                instrument as I do” than the person “who can recite MDN backward and forward.”
                Career Changers: Why Did You Make the Switch?
                What’s your “why?” Many interviewers like to ask “why” to figure out who is in it 
                for the money and who is in it because they are truly, genuinely interested in creating
                something awesome. Construct an elevator pitch if you don’t already have one – a short, 
                30-second snippet of who you are, what you do, and where you see yourself going. Here’s 
                an example:
                “Hi, I’m Christina. I’m a musician that took her love of practicing, mentoring students, 
                and breaking down problems and turned it into a tech career, if you can believe it!” 
                “I’m currently a technical writer, creating blogs and articles for beginner level to 
                professional level developers and engineers. I see that you got your start in writing 
                as well! I would love to be able to pick your brain about how to transition to web 
                development.” When you create your elevator pitch, it helps guide you into thinking 
                about why you are taking the coding or tech journey. Be thinking about this as you head 
                into that initial interview.</li>
                <li><strong>Questions to Think About: </strong>
                There are several interview questions, that no matter the industry, always seem to pop 
                up in interview situations. Knowing the answers to these questions will prepare 
                you better for your interview. 
                Keep a notebook or the notepad app open to jot down ideas and flesh out ones you’ve 
                thought through. Think about or jot down anecdotes to share that answer the 
                following questions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your greatest strength?</li>
                    <li>What is your greatest weakness?</li>
                    <li>Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker?</li>
                    <li>What makes you unique?</li>
                    <li>Why should we hire you?</li>
                </ul> 
                <li><strong>Know the Market Rate for Developers and Engineers in Your Area: </strong>
                If you happen to live in the middle of the Midwest but are interviewing for an 
                engineering position in Seattle or San Francisco, it’s definitely a good idea to 
                research median and average level salaries for a software engineer/developer in the 
                area you will be living in before you comment on any salary requirements. Many times 
                a recruiter will immediately ask for a salary expectation – if you don’t know the 
                numbers for the area, you can possibly sell yourself short.
                Hint: Respond with “What is the budget for this position?” and see what the recruiter 
                has to say.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare a Q&A for the Interviewer: </strong>
                Interviewers tend to leave 10 minutes or so at the end of the interview to open the 
                floor for questions. This can be a time for you to shine. Take the time to ask the 
                interviewer about the culture of the workplace, how the company responds to disease 
                pandemic situations, what the work/life balance is like, etc. Remember, this is 
                usually answered in your initial interview, so don’t bring up anything yet in relation 
                to salary or bonuses/benefits unless they open the floor to that conversation.</li>

                <li><strong>Use STAR Method to Tell Your Anecdotes: </strong>
                In the previous section, we talked about coming up with anecdotes to talk about 
                all of those really tough interview questions. There is a method, called the 
                STAR Method, that can assist in crafting an engaging anecdote.
                If you can follow these four guidelines when answering your questions, you 
                will do very well. STAR stands for:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>S - Situation: the basic setup or premise of your anecdote. It sets the stage.</li>
                    <li>T - Task: your responsibility within the situation. What can you quantify here?</li>
                    <li>A - Action: the breakdown of what it took to get you from point A to point B.</li>
                    <li>R - Result: the outcome of the action.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Ask Questions: </strong>
                Don’t be afraid to ask questions! You are interviewing the company as much as 
                they are interviewing you.
                By the same token, if something is not clear, be sure to ask a clarifying 
                question to make sure you understand the initial ask.</li>

                <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode127', 'showCode127')">Close</button>
                <li>Interview Follow-up
                After the interviews are over, keep in close contact with the recruiter. They will be the ones to help navigate you through the next steps. If you don’t have e-mail addresses for the interviewers who talked to you, ask the recruiter for them so you can send a thank-you note for taking the time to speak with you.
                The thank-you note doesn’t have to be anything lavish or fancy. Here’s a simple 
                example:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Dear [ name of interviewer ]:
                    
                    I just wanted to take the time to thank you for meeting with me today about [ position applied for at [ company applied to ].
                    [ Mention something here about anything you’ve discussed during the interview that might be memorable so they will remember your meeting ].
                    If there are any other questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Thanks again.
                    
                    Sincerely,
                    [ Your Name ]</i></li>
                </ul>
                <hr/>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Remember to Breathe</strong></li>

            <div id="displayCode128">
                <button onclick="closeCode('displayCode128', 'showCode128')">Close</button>
                <li>This is the first interview of many if all goes well! Remember to take full 
                breaths to keep yourself as calm as you can be, try not to interrupt the 
                interviewer (It’s hard to do sometimes when you’re interviewing via phone or 
                video conference!), and, most of all, have fun. You will only get better as you
                do more behavioral interviews!</li>
