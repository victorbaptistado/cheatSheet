            <h2>Operational System</h2>
            <h3>Computer interaction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The four main functions that makes a computer's interactions possible are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input: </strong>From clicking our mouse to turning up the volume of the speakers during our favorite song, 
                    we are constantly giving our computers input. We can think of input as how we as people 
                    physically interact with computers. We give our computer commands by interacting with 
                    various physical sensors (like buttons) which then get turned into data for our computer 
                    to process. First, we need to establish a connection from our input device to our computer through a physical port, which is usually attached to the computer’s motherboard.
                    The input device’s job is to detect and report any type of event; for example, a mouse can 
                    sense the action of being clicked. Once an event is received by the input device, it reacts 
                    by sending information to the CPU. In order to properly “speak” with the CPU, information 
                    needs to be communicated using binary code which are instructions composed of 0s and 1s.
                    Once the input is converted into binary, it is sent to the CPU to be processed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing: </strong>Once we have some data, we need to process it so that our computer can figure out what 
                    we’re asking it to do and how to execute those requests. The job of processing information 
                    is given to the central processing unit, or CPU.
                    The CPU controls all the different components between hardware and software. We can think 
                    of it as the “brain” of the computer! The CPU also holds the responsibility of establishing 
                    communication between hardware and software. For example, if we turn the dial on our 
                    speakers up, data about that interaction is sent to the CPU. The CPU then deciphers the 
                    information and sends instructions to the speaker about how to handle this task. If we 
                    want to run software on our computer, it is also up to the CPU to perform all the necessary operations.
                    That’s a lot of responsibility for one piece of hardware. With all the different software 
                    and processes available to us, how can the CPU take in information and execute the 
                    associated instructions so quickly? This is where computer memory comes in handy!</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory: </strong>Our computers have a lot of information to process - where does all this data get stored? 
                    Computer memory refers to the system or device used to store computer-based data temporarily
                    or permanently. The type of hardware we use to store data depends a lot on how long we need 
                    to hold on to that information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Primary Memory: </strong>
                        Not all memory needs to last forever. Sometimes we just need information temporarily. 
                        For example, if we want to order food, we only need to remember the restaurant’s phone number 
                        long enough for us to dial the number - then we can forget that information until the next 
                        time we order food.
                        This same idea applies to running software on our computers. When a command to run a program 
                        is sent to the CPU, the CPU retrieves data from Random Access Memory, or RAM, in order to 
                        access what instructions it needs to execute. Accessing data from RAM is significantly faster 
                        than accessing data from other memory systems.
                        This type of data is also only stored temporarily; once we exit a program or turn off the 
                        computer, the data is lost. For example, if we exit a word-processing application before 
                        saving, anything we wrote in the document is gone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Memory: </strong>If we upload 150 photos to our computer, the 
                        computer needs a space to permanently store the 
                        data associated with the images so that we could access the pictures anytime. This type of 
                        data would most likely be saved onto our computer’s hard drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Output: </strong>
                    Once the CPU processes data and sends out instructions on how to handle it, output is 
                    produced! We can think of output as the computer fulfilling the command we gave it 
                    through an output device. Some examples of output devices:
                    Monitors, Speakers, Printers.
                    For example, if we clicked a mouse to open a file, the output would be the monitor 
                    displaying the file’s content. If we turned the volume on our speakers up, the output 
                    would be the sound becoming louder.
                    Output is the final step in the process of our computer interaction.</li>

            <h3>Important Hardware</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> is the electronic circuitry that executes 
                instructions based on an input of binary data (0’s and 1’s). The CPU consists of three main components:
                Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), Registers (Immediate Access Store).
                These components are all wired in very specific ways in order to process data. It is 
                important here to remember that data, to our hardware, is a series of binary, on and off, 
                electrical pulses. These pulses are run through different wires, semiconductors, and components 
                as a means to process and return data that is usable by the software. Now that we have a general
                understanding of the CPU, let’s dive a little deeper.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Control Unit (CU)</strong>
                    is the overseer of the CPU, responsible for controlling and monitoring the input and 
                    output of data from the computer’s hardware. The Control Unit is the component 
                    receiving instructions from the software and running the show. Its primary job is 
                    making sure that data is sent to the right component, at the right time, and arrives 
                    with integrity.
                    Part of this job is keeping all the hardware working on the same schedule. It does this 
                    with a clock, which sends out a regular electrical signal to all components at the same 
                    time to coordinate activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</strong>
                    is where all the processing on your computer takes place. Even as you scroll this text box, 
                    the ALU is calculating pixel changes on the screen and sending that output to the monitor. 
                    The ALU is the fundamental building block of the CPU, the brains of the entire computer. 
                    Nearly all functional processing occurs in this chip. As the name implies, the ALU’s 
                    functions can be divided into two primary areas:
                    Arithmetic operations that deal with calculating data (e.g. 5 * 4 = 20)
                    Logic operations that deal with comparisons and conditionals (e.g. 25 > 10).</li>
                    <li><strong>Registers</strong>
                    The register, or immediate access store, is limited space, high-speed memory that the CPU 
                    can use for quick processing. Registers are small pieces of memory right on the CPU. They 
                    are fixed in number and defined in the Instruction Set Architecture. There are typically 8,
                    16, 32, or 64 registers depending on the architecture and are also fixed in size based on 
                    the size of the number it can hold. They provide the CPU with a place to store and access 
                    values that are crucial to the immediate calculations the ALU is processing.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Memory: </strong>
                Other important components of hardware include Random Access Memory (RAM), buses (high-speed 
                wires), as well as a hard disk and other non-volatile memory.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong>
                    is additional high-speed memory that a computer uses to store and access information on a 
                    short-term basis. In general, a computer’s performance can be directly correlated to the amount 
                    of RAM it has available to use. RAM is considered primary volatile memory, which means it loses 
                    whatever is stored on it as soon as power is disconnected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buses </strong>A bus is an engineering term for a job-specific high-speed wire. These wires are often 
                    group together in bundles and will transfer electrical signals either in parallel or in 
                    serial, that is many signals at once or one pulse at a time. Buses can be grouped into 
                    three functions: data buses, address buses, and control buses.
                    <strong>Data buses</strong> carry data back and forth between the processor and other components. Data buses
                    are bidirectional, which means that they transfer data both to and from other locations.
                    <strong>Address buses</strong> carry a specific address in memory and are unidirectional. We can visualize 
                    all of our memory like a village with each house representing a package of data. Every 
                    house/data has an address. When our computer tells a program or component what data to use, 
                    it sends the address and then the component knows where to find the data when it needs it.
                    <strong>Control buses</strong> are also unidirectional and are responsible for carrying the 
                    control signals of the CU to other components as well as the clock signals for 
                    synchronization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Disks</strong> or hard drives, are responsible for the long-term, or 
                    secondary storage of data and programs. This is an example of non-volatile memory, meaning 
                    that it will retain its information when we shut down our computer.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr/>
                <h3>Additional Hardwares</h3>
                <li><strong>The Mainboard </strong>or motherboard, is a printed circuit board that houses 
                important hardware components via ports. Hardware such as the CPU, the hard drive, 
                various USB devices, and more are connected through ports on the mainboard. 
                The mainboard allows these components to communicate easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Ports: </strong>
                A port is a physical outlet used to connect outside, IO (Input/Output) devices to a 
                computer. A computer typically contains multiple ports. This connection allows for 
                communication between the IO device and our computers. Examples of IO devices include
                keyboards, mice, and monitors.</li>
